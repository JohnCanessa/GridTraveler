# GridTraveler
Travel a grid from the top-left to the bottom-right moving only right or down.

I was exposed to this problem while watching:

Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges

I then ran into a similar problem at:

62. Unique Paths
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/

Recided to kill two birds with the same stone.
If you are interested in my approach and comments
I invite you to read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read and experiment.

Enjoy;
